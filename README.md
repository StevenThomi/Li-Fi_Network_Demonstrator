# Li-Fi Network Demonstrator

This repository serves to document my Final Year Project.

This research project aims to develop a Li-Fi system capable of sustaining a data transfer rate of at least 100 kbps. The research project covers material from both the field of analogue electronics and telecommunications. The project develops an understanding of communication systems by covering both a hardware and a software life-cycle in the system development. 

Li-Fi is an up and coming visible light communication scheme that is intended to support indoor communication systems by creating small, dense cells. This research project will develop a Li-Fi cell capable of transmitting data along a single carrier using affordable, off-the-shelf components.


This repository is organised as follows:

The **Data** directory contains the performance test data collected over the course of the research project.

The **Python** directory contains the code run on the transmit and receive terminals, including the accuracy test used to match for system error. The Python directory is a child directory to the Data directory.

The **Simulation** directory contains the simulation files used to run design tests on the system at its initial stages.
